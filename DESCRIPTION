Description: Based on the illness-death model a large number of clinical
    trials with oncology endpoints progression-free survival (PFS) and
    overall survival (OS) can be simulated, see Meller, Beyersmann and
    Rufibach (2019) <doi:10.1002/sim.8295>.  The simulation set-up allows
    for random and event-driven censoring, an arbitrary number of
    treatment arms, staggered study entry and drop-out.  Exponentially,
    Weibull and piecewise exponentially distributed survival times can be
    generated. The correlation between PFS and OS can be calculated.
